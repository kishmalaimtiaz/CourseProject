#Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
##Modifications
The original data was modified by merging the training and the test data sets to create one data set, after which only the measurements on mean and standard deviation were extracted.
The names were changed to be more descriptive. Finally an independent tidy set was created containing average of each activity for each subject. 

##Descriptions
###Identififiers
The first two columns - Subject and Activity - are Identifiers.

Subject: the ID of the Subject
Activity: the Name of the Activity performed by the subject when measurements were taken
###Measurements
As mentioned above,the variables remaining are just the calculatd means and standard deviations of these sets of data:
